## What is the SPL Vitalizer MK2-T Plugin?
 
The SPL Vitalizer MK2-T plugin is a spot-on emulation of the SPL Vitalizer MK2-T hardware unit, which is a tube-based processor that uses a patented technology called Vitalizing. Vitalizing is a process that adjusts the frequency spectrum of audio signals according to human hearing, which makes them more intelligible, louder, and more spacious. The Vitalizer MK2-T plugin has four main sections: Bass, Mid-Hi Tune, Stereo Expander, and Process.
  
### Bass
 
The Bass section allows you to control the low end of your mix by using two knobs: Bass and Drive. The Bass knob lets you adjust the amount of bass enhancement or reduction, while the Drive knob lets you adjust the amount of tube saturation and compression. You can also choose between three modes: Tight, Soft, and Medium. Tight mode gives you a punchy and defined bass sound, Soft mode gives you a smooth and warm bass sound, and Medium mode gives you a balanced bass sound.
  
### Mid-Hi Tune
 
The Mid-Hi Tune section allows you to control the mid and high frequencies of your mix by using two knobs: Mid-Hi Tune and Intensity. The Mid-Hi Tune knob lets you select the center frequency of a bell-shaped filter that boosts or cuts the mid-high range, while the Intensity knob lets you adjust the amount of boost or cut. You can also choose between two modes: LC and RC. LC mode uses coil filters (inductors and capacitors) to create a smooth and natural sound, while RC mode uses resistor-capacitor filters to create a sharper and more precise sound.
  
### Stereo Expander
 
The Stereo Expander section allows you to control the stereo width of your mix by using two knobs: Stereo Expander and Balance. The Stereo Expander knob lets you adjust the amount of stereo enhancement or reduction, while the Balance knob lets you adjust the left-right balance of your mix. You can also choose between two modes: Mono and Stereo. Mono mode collapses your mix to mono, while Stereo mode preserves your original stereo image.
  
### Process
 
The Process section allows you to control the overall effect of the Vitalizer MK2-T plugin by using two knobs: Process and Output. The Process knob lets you adjust the amount of Vitalizing applied to your mix, while the Output knob lets you adjust the output level of your mix. You can also choose between two modes: Bypass and Active. Bypass mode bypasses the plugin completely, while Active mode enables the plugin.
  
## How to Use the SPL Vitalizer MK2-T Plugin to Enhance Your Mixes?
 
The SPL Vitalizer MK2-T plugin can be used on individual tracks, subgroups, or the master bus to enhance your mixes in different ways. Here are some examples of how to use the plugin in different scenarios:
  
### Enhancing Vocals
 
If you want to make your vocals more clear, loud, and present in your mix, you can use the SPL Vitalizer MK2-T plugin on your vocal track or bus with these settings:
 
- Bass: -4 (Tight mode)
- Mid-Hi Tune: 4 kHz (LC mode)
- Intensity: +4
- Stereo Expander: 0 (Stereo mode)
- Process: +6

These settings will reduce some low-end mud from your vocals, boost some presence and clarity in the mid-high range, and apply some gentle Vitalizing to make your vocals
