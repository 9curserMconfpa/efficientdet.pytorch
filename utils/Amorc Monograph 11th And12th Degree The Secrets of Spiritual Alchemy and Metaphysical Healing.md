# The Rosicrucian Order and Its Monographs
 
The Rosicrucian Order, also known as AMORC (Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis), is a worldwide fraternal organization that claims to perpetuate the ancient wisdom and teachings of the Rosicrucians, a mystical movement that emerged in Europe in the 17th century. AMORC offers its members a system of study and initiation through a series of monographs, which are written instructions on various topics related to philosophy, science, spirituality, and practical life.

According to AMORC, the monographs are divided into degrees, each representing a stage of spiritual and personal development. The degrees are further subdivided into sections, such as Neophyte, Temple, Illuminati, etc. The monographs are intended to be studied in a sequential order, with each one building on the previous ones. The monographs also contain exercises, experiments, rituals, and meditations that aim to help the members apply the principles and laws they learn.
 
One of the most advanced degrees in AMORC is the Eleventh Degree, which is part of the Illuminati Section. This degree deals with the mysteries of reincarnation and karma, and teaches the members how to access their past lives and balance their karmic debts. The monographs of this degree also explore the concepts of soul mates, soul groups, soul evolution, and soul purpose.

The Twelfth Degree is the final degree of the Illuminati Section, and it prepares the members for the transition to the next section, which is called the Cosmic Cycle. This degree focuses on the cosmic laws and forces that govern the universe and all life forms. The monographs of this degree also teach the members how to attune with their cosmic consciousness and cosmic mission, and how to use their psychic faculties for service and healing.
 
The monographs of AMORC are considered to be confidential and sacred by the members, and they are not supposed to be shared or published without permission. They are also regarded as personal property of AMORC, and they must be returned or destroyed upon request or upon termination of membership. The monographs are said to contain hidden symbols and codes that can only be deciphered by those who have been properly initiated and instructed by AMORC.
  
The history of the Rosicrucian Order is shrouded in mystery and controversy. Some scholars and historians have argued that the original Rosicrucian brotherhood was a fictional invention of Andreae and his associates, who used it as a vehicle for promoting their reformist and utopian ideas. Others have suggested that there was a real historical basis for the Rosicrucian movement, and that it had connections with various occult and mystical traditions, such as Gnosticism, Hermeticism, Alchemy, Kabbalah, Freemasonry, and Templarism.
 
Regardless of its historical origins, Rosicrucianism has inspired and influenced many individuals and groups throughout the centuries. Some of the most notable figures who have been associated with Rosicrucianism include Francis Bacon, Robert Fludd, Elias Ashmole, Isaac Newton, Michael Maier, Comenius, RenÃ© Descartes, Gottfried Leibniz, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, William Blake, Novalis, Victor Hugo, Ãliphas LÃ©vi, Helena Blavatsky, Rudolf Steiner, Max Heindel, Aleister Crowley, Paul Foster Case, Manly P. Hall, and H. Spencer Lewis.
 
Today, there are several organizations that claim to be the legitimate heirs or successors of the original Rosicrucian Order. Some of the most prominent ones are the Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis (AMORC), founded by H. Spencer Lewis in 1915; the Rosicrucian Fellowship (RF), founded by Max Heindel in 1909; the Lectorium Rosicrucianum (LR), founded by Jan van Rijckenborgh and Catharose de Petri in 1924; and the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia (SRIA), founded by Robert Wentworth Little in 1865. These organizations differ in their doctrines, practices, rituals, and affiliations, but they all share a common interest in the Rosicrucian heritage and teachings.
