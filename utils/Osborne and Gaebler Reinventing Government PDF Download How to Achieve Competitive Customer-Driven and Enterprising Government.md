If you are curious about what the book covers, here is a brief summary of its main points:

1. **Steer more than they row.** This principle means that public managers should focus on setting goals and policies, rather than directly providing services. They should delegate service delivery to other entities, such as private businesses, nonprofits, or community groups, that can do it more efficiently and effectively.
2. **Empower communities rather than simply deliver services.** This principle means that public managers should involve citizens and stakeholders in the design and delivery of public services, rather than treating them as passive recipients. They should give them more choices, voice, and control over the services they receive.
3. **Encourage competition rather than monopoly.** This principle means that public managers should create a competitive environment for service providers, rather than granting them exclusive rights or privileges. They should allow multiple providers to compete for customers and contracts, and reward them based on their performance and quality.
4. **Be driven by their missions, not their rules.** This principle means that public managers should focus on achieving their desired outcomes, rather than following rigid procedures and regulations. They should give their employees more flexibility and autonomy to innovate and adapt to changing circumstances.
5. **Fund outcomes rather than inputs.** This principle means that public managers should allocate resources based on the results they want to achieve, rather than the inputs they use. They should link funding to performance and accountability, and allow service providers to keep any savings or profits they generate.
6. **Meet the needs of the customer, not the bureaucracy.** This principle means that public managers should orient their services around the needs and preferences of their customers, rather than the convenience of their bureaucracy. They should solicit feedback from their customers and use it to improve their quality and satisfaction.
7. **Concentrate on earning, not just spending.** This principle means that public managers should seek to generate revenue from their services, rather than rely solely on taxes or grants. They should charge fees for some services, sell assets or licenses, or create partnerships with private or nonprofit entities that can provide funding or resources.
8. **Invest in prevention rather than cure.** This principle means that public managers should focus on preventing problems from occurring, rather than fixing them after they happen. They should invest in long-term solutions that address the root causes of social issues, such as education, health care, or community development.
9. **Decentralize authority.** This principle means that public managers should devolve power and responsibility to lower levels of government or organization, rather than centralize them at the top. They should empower local governments, agencies, teams, or individuals to make decisions and take actions that suit their specific contexts and needs.
10. **Solve problems by leveraging the marketplace, rather than simply creating public programs.** This principle means that public managers should use market mechanisms and incentives to address public problems, rather than create new public programs or bureaucracies. They should use tools such as vouchers, subsidies, contracts, or regulations to influence the behavior of private or nonprofit actors in the public interest.

By applying these principles, Osborne and Gaebler argue that public managers can reinvent government and make it more responsive, efficient, effective, and accountable. They provide numerous examples of successful cases where these principles have been implemented in various sectors and levels of government. They also acknowledge the challenges and limitations of reinventing government, such as political resistance, cultural inertia, legal constraints, or ethical dilemmas. They offer some suggestions on how to overcome these obstacles and foster a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship in the public sector.
