# How to Fix Diablo 2 Multires Error: Unable to Load D2MultiRes.dll
 
Diablo 2 Multires is a mod that allows you to play Diablo 2 in higher resolutions than the original game. However, some players may encounter an error message when trying to launch the mod: "Unable to load D2MultiRes.dll". This error can be caused by various reasons, such as incompatible game version, missing or corrupted files, or incorrect installation. In this article, we will show you how to fix this error and enjoy Diablo 2 Multires without any problems.
 
## Step 1: Check Your Game Version
 
Diablo 2 Multires only works with Diablo 2 version 1.12a. If you have a different version of the game, you will need to downgrade it to 1.12a. You can check your game version by looking at the bottom left corner of the main menu screen. If you have version 1.13 or higher, you can download the official patch 1.12a from Blizzard's website[^1^] and install it over your existing game. If you have version 1.07 or lower, you can upgrade it to 1.12a by logging onto Battle.net and letting it update automatically.

## Step 2: Download and Install Diablo 2 Multires
 
Once you have Diablo 2 version 1.12a, you can download the Diablo 2 Multires mod from Mod DB[^3^] and extract it to your Diablo 2 folder. Make sure you overwrite any existing files when prompted. You should see a new file called D2MultiResGame.exe in your Diablo 2 folder.
 
## Step 3: Run Diablo 2 Multires and Choose Your Resolution
 
To run Diablo 2 Multires, you need to launch the D2MultiResGame.exe file instead of the regular Diablo II.exe file. The first time you run it, it will generate a log file called D2MultiResLog.txt in your Diablo 2 folder. This file contains a list of resolutions that your system supports. You can choose your desired resolution by editing the D2MultiRes.ini file in your Diablo 2 folder. Find the line that says "Resolution = " and change it to the resolution you want, for example "Resolution = 1920x1080". Save the file and run D2MultiResGame.exe again.
 
## Step 4: Enjoy Diablo 2 Multires
 
If everything went well, you should be able to play Diablo 2 in your chosen resolution without any errors. Note that Diablo 2 Multires only works in single player mode or TCP/IP multiplayer mode. It does not work on Battle.net or with other mods. Also, some features of the game may not work properly in higher resolutions, such as mouse cursor position, inventory size, or item drop rates. These are limitations of the original game engine and cannot be fixed by the mod.

## Step 5: Troubleshoot Common Problems
 
Diablo 2 Multires is a great mod that enhances the graphics of Diablo 2, but it is not perfect. You may encounter some common problems when using it, such as black screen, game crash, or missing textures. Here are some possible solutions for these problems:
 
- Black screen: This may happen if your resolution is not supported by your monitor or graphics card. Try lowering your resolution in the D2MultiRes.ini file or using a different aspect ratio (4:3, 16:9, or 16:10).
- Game crash: This may happen if you have incompatible files or settings in your Diablo 2 folder. Try deleting the D2MultiRes.dll and D2MultiRes.mpq files and reinstalling the mod. Also, make sure you run the game as administrator and in compatibility mode for Windows XP Service Pack 3.
- Missing textures: This may happen if you have corrupted or outdated files in your Diablo 2 folder. Try deleting the Data folder and reinstalling the mod. Also, make sure you have the latest version of DirectX and your graphics card drivers.

If none of these solutions work for you, you can check the official forum for more help from other users or report a bug to the mod developers.
